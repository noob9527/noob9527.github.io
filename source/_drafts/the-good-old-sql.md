> You may wondering why I'm still learning SQL, after all, it's 9012 now. Well, the first reason is I'v been staying noob for such a long time, understanding how relational database works is still a huge challenge to me; Secondly, I haven't encountered any situation which I have to resort to a NoSQL database. In this post, I'd like to share the reasons why I always bet on a traditional database for OLTP workloads, Anyway, you can also interpret it as the excuses why I refuse to learn other popular databases like MongoDB.

### Declarative vs Imperative
The first reason why I was not interested in NoSQL technology is the name NoSQL. 

As if it is SQL's fault to slow down the storage engine.


SQL is so flexible

### Transactional vs Non-Transactional

### Normalization vs Denormalization

### Data-first vs Query-first
